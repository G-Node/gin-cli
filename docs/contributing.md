# Contribution and developer guide

This document is a guide for contributing to the development of the GIN client.  The document (and related linked documents) are separated into two categories:
- [Developer resources](#developer-resources): Documents describing the project structure and conventions.  Read this before contributing code to fix bugs or add features.
- [Communication and contact](#communication-and-contact): Guides for how to contact the development team to report bugs, propose features, etc.


## Developer resources

- [Project and code structure](project-structure.md): The structure of the project (subpackages and their purpose) and the general program flow.
- [Command translation](command-translation.md): Mapping between GIN CLI commands to git and git-annex operations (with configuration details specific to GIN).
- [Web errors](weberrors.md): A list of all the error codes that the GIN server can return (for endpoints used in the client) and what they mean.


## Communication and contact

Feel free to open issues for reporting bugs or requesting features for the GIN CLI [in this repository](https://github.com/G-Node/gin-cli/issues/new).
We kindly ask that you first search through the existing issues [here](https://github.com/G-Node/gin-cli/issues/) or [on the GIN website](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/issues) to avoid duplicate reporting.


For general questions or problems with the GIN services, you can visit the [GIN help](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/info/wiki) pages and report issues on the [GIN website](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/issues).
