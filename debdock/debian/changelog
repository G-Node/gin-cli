gin-cli (1.1); urgency=low

  * Release 1.1
  * Bug fix: The port was not being stored properly when using the input
    prompts to set up a new server configuration.
  * Bug fix: In some cases, the host key was not written to the `known_hosts` file in the format required (especially for `localhost`).

gin-cli (1.0); urgency=low

  * Release 1.0
  * New command `gin init`: Initialises a directory as a gin repository without creating a repository on a server.
  * New command `gin commit`: Records changes in the local repository without performing an upload and without requiring a remote or an internet connection.
  * New command `gin version`: Rolls back files or directories to older versions. With the `--copy-to` flag, retrieves older files without overwriting the current version and copies them to a specific location.
  * New command `gin add-remote`: Adds a remote to the current repository for uploading and downloading. This also brings support for using directory paths on the local filesystem as "remotes" (e.g., external hard drives, network attached storage), without the need to have a GIN server.
  * New command `gin remove-remote`: Removes a remote from the current repository.
  * New command `gin remotes`: Lists remotes configured for a repository and shows the default remote used for `gin upload`.
  * New command `gin use-remote`: Switches the repository's default upload remote.
  * The `gin upload` command now accepts a `--to` argument for uploading annexed content to a specific, non-default remote.
  * New command `gin add-server`: Adds a new GIN server to the global client configuration.
  * New command `gin remove-server`: Removes a GIN server from the global client configuration.
  * New command `gin servers`: Lists the configured servers and shows the default server used for web queries.
  * New command `gin use-server`: Switches the default server.
  * The `login`, `logout`, `create`, `info`, `keys`, `repos`, `repoinfo`, and `get` commands now accept a `--server` argument for querying or operating on a specific, non-default server.
  * Progress bars for file operations: Some operations don't have a per-file progress (add, lock, unlock). There is no partial unlock state for a file, for instance. For these commands, the output shows the overall progress along with the number of total files that are being affected.
  * Smaller logfiles: The log file is now limited to 1 MB. No more ever-growing logs.
  * The client is now usable even without git-annex installed, but commands that require git and git-annex are disabled.
  * Progress is now also printed when uploading git files.
  * Minimum required got-annex version: 6.20171109
  * Fixed a bug where file tracking would register a type change in git when working with direct mode repositories (e.g., on Windows).
  * Fixed a bug where the file status (from `gin ls`) was being incorrectly reported when working in direct mode (e.g., on Windows). Direct mode repositories should now show the exact same output as indirect mode ones.

gin-cli (0.16); urgency=low

  * Release 0.16
  * Logging changes: More useful logging info and command delimitation.
  * Relevant help: When a command is given bad arguments, instead of printing the general help/usage info, it now prints the help/usage for that specific command.
  * Fix for stuttering/flashing of text during progress printing on Windows.
  * Completely redone command line argument handling and better help formatting.
  * New command `gin repoinfo`: Prints the information for a single repository on the server 

gin-cli (0.15); urgency=low

  * Release 0.15
  * Minor change in `gin download` behaviour.

gin-cli (0.14); urgency=low

  * Release 0.14

  * Various improvements and bug fixes.

gin-cli (0.13); urgency=low

  * Release 0.13

gin-cli (0.12); urgency=low

  * Release 0.12
  * Support creating new repository and setting up current directory as local
    clone: `gin create --here`.
  * Support `--json` output for most commands.
  * New location for configuration and log files. Old files are transferred
    automatically on first run.
  * Unless `--json` is specified, any command that requires login will
    prompt for login if the user is not logged in
  * Local config file can only be used for annex.minsize and annex.excludes
    options. All other options are ignored.
  * Local config file is never checked into annex, regardless of annex minsize
    rule.

    other user's available repositories.

gin-cli (0.11); urgency=low

    specified in a file called config.yml in the root of a repository will
    override options from the global and default configurations.

    the user's key insted of the one generated by gin (macOS).
  * Fixed issue which caused very slow responses on Windows when repositories got too big.

gin-cli (0.10); urgency=low

  * Release 0.10
  * Minor bug fixes and improvements.
  * Improved the performance of `gin ls` when querying specific files.
