# GIN CLI command translation

How GIN CLI commands translate to git and git-annex operations.

*Nb: This document does not mention any system or GIN web API calls unless they are necessary to explain a git or git-annex operation.*

## gin upload

Brief: `gin upload <filenames>` â†’ `git-annex-add <filenames>` (with filtering) > `git add <filenames>` (leftover from filter) > `git-annex sync --no-pull --commit` > `git-annex copy --to=origin`

The `gin upload` command takes care of every step from the adding of a file to the git index up until it arrives on the server.
In the steps outlined below, `<filenames>` refers to a list of files or directories supplied by the user on the command line when invoking the command.


1. `git-annex add`: The client first adds files to the annex. This doesn't add all files matched by `<filenames>` to the annex; instead the files are filtered based on certain rules about what should go into git and what should go into the annex. See [filtering](filtering.md) for details on this.
2. `git add`: Any files that were filtered out in step 1 and therefore not added to the annex are added to git.
3. `git-annex sync --no-pull --commit`: This command performs a number of operations in and of itself. Since git-annex, much like our GIN client, wraps git operations in many cases, this is not uncommon, but it can make describing exactly what is happening a bit harder.
4. `git-annex copy --to=origin`: This copies any new annexed content to the remote named origin (the default remote). In the background, git-annex used rsync to transfer the files.

Step 3 is itself a multistep operation, so let's break it down further. First, it performs a `git commit` (specified by the `--commit` flag). The client specifies a commit message with subject `GIN upload from <HOSTNAME>` and the body describes the changes associated with the commit (file addition, deletion, and modification counts).
Then a `git push` is performed, along with a few git-annex bookkeeping tasks that are handled in the annex branches.
The `--no-pull` flag ensures that this sync operation does not do a bidirectional sync. Since this is part of the `gin upload` command, the client does not attempt to pull and merge any changes that may have occurred on the server.
If there are changes on the server that have not been pulled, the push will fail.

### Code

The `gin upload` command starts in the [`cmd/uploadcmd.go/upload`][uploadcmd.go] function, but all the important steps are broken down in the [`gin-client/repos.go/Upload`][repos.go] function.
The [`gin-client/git.go/AnnexAdd`][git.go] and [`gin-client/git.go/GitAdd`][git.go] commands handle the `git-annex add` and `git add` operations respectively.
Finally, [`gin-client/git.go/AnnexPush`][git.go] performs the `git-annex sync` and `git-annex copy` operations.
